<div class="mouse-body">Maisie and the Everywhere Mouse is a mix of Science Fiction and Fairy Tale with some strong themes of environmental 
    responsibility.<p></p>

      Maisie, along with her Mum and Dad, eats printed food, wears printed clothes and lives in fear of a deadly virus which a 
      century ago almost wiped out the human race.<p>
      Earth has been observed from afar for countless centuries by Post Physical Beings who love all life and 
      occasionally send a team of Observers who, while largely unnoticed, have created our legends of Guardian Angels 
      and Genies and Fairy Godmothers.<P>
      There is a problem with the latest Observation and the Actuator has materialised in two dimensional form and needs the help of his mechanic, currently in the form of a mouse, along with Maisie and her bigger, human hands, to complete the mission and prevent the complete extermination of the human race. 
      <P>
         <p>
          <p> 
          Maisie, along with her friends and parents, must in find a way for humanity to survive and free itself of its past</div>
